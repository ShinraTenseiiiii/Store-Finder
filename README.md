    -   **MongoDB & Mongoose:**  Flexible NoSQL database.
    -   **Postman:**  Tool for API testing and development.
    -   **Geocoder:**   `node-geocoder` Library for geocoding addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.
    -   **OpenCage :**  Provides API KEY as a free service to for geocoding and reverse-geocoding.
    
-   **Frontend (Pending):** 
    
    -   **Bootstrap:**  Building responsive user interfaces.
    -   **Mapbox:**  (Premium Subscription Required) Mapping service for visualizing store locations.

**Getting Started:**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    
    -   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
    -   A MongoDB database instance running.

    
2.  **Install dependencies:**
 
    ```cd Store-Finder```
   ``` npm install```
 

    
3.  **Configuration:**
    
    -   Add environment variables for your MongoDB connection string and any other sensitive information required by the application (e.g., Mapbox access token).
    -   Update the database configuration in  `models`  directory (e.g.,  `Store.js`) if needed to match your specific MongoDB setup.
4.  **Run the application:**

**Develop Locally:**


```npm run dev```


**Deploy (Production):**


```node server.js```
